=== TLS Handshake

The gateway maintains a client pool that it uses to route to backends.
When communicating over HTTPS, the client initiates a TLS handshake.
A number of timeouts are associated with this handshake.
You can configure these timeouts can be configured (defaults shown) as follows:

.application.yml

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      httpclient:
        ssl:
          handshake-timeout-millis: 10000
          close-notify-flush-timeout-millis: 3000
          close-notify-read-timeout-millis: 0
