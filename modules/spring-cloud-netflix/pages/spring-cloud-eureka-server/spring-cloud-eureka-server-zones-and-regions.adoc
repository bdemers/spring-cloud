=== High Availability, Zones and Regions

The Eureka server does not have a back end store, but the service instances in the registry all have to send heartbeats to keep their registrations up to date (so this can be done in memory).
Clients also have an in-memory cache of Eureka registrations (so they do not have to go to the registry for every request to a service).

By default, every Eureka server is also a Eureka client and requires (at least one) service URL to locate a peer.
If you do not provide it, the service runs and works, but it fills your logs with a lot of noise about not being able to register with the peer.

See also xref:spring-cloud-ribbon:spring-cloud-ribbon.adoc#spring-cloud-ribbon[below for details of Ribbon support] on the client side for Zones and Regions.
