=== Retrieving the Routes Defined in the Gateway

To retrieve the routes defined in the gateway, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/gateway/routes`.
The resulting response is similar to the following:

====
----
[{
  "route_id": "first_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.handler.predicate.PathRoutePredicateFactory$$Lambda$432/1736826640@1e9d7e7d",
    "filters": [
      "OrderedGatewayFilter{delegate=org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.PreserveHostHeaderGatewayFilterFactory$$Lambda$436/674480275@6631ef72, order=0}"
    ]
  },
  "order": 0
},
{
  "route_id": "second_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.handler.predicate.PathRoutePredicateFactory$$Lambda$432/1736826640@cd8d298",
    "filters": []
  },
  "order": 0
}]
----
====

The response contains the details of all the routes defined in the gateway.
The following table describes the structure of each element (each is a route) of the response:

[cols="3,2,4"]
