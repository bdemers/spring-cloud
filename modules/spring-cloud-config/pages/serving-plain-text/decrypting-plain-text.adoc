=== Decrypting Plain Text

By default, encrypted values in plain text files are not decrypted. In order to enable decryption for plain text files, set `spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.enabled=true` and `spring.cloud.config.server.encrypt.plainTextEncrypt=true` in `bootstrap.[yml|properties]`

NOTE: Decrypting plain text files is only supported for YAML, JSON, and properties file extensions.

If this feature is enabled, and an unsupported file extention is requested, any encrypted values in the file will not be decrypted.
