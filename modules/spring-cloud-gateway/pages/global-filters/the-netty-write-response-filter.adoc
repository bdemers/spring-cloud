=== The Netty Write Response Filter

The `NettyWriteResponseFilter` runs if there is a Netty `HttpClientResponse` in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.CLIENT_RESPONSE_ATTR` exchange attribute.
It runs after all other filters have completed and writes the proxy response back to the gateway client response.
(There is also an experimental `WebClientWriteResponseFilter` that performs the same function but does not require Netty.)
