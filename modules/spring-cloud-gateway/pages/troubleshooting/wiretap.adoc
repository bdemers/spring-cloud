=== Wiretap

The Reactor Netty `HttpClient` and `HttpServer` can have wiretap enabled.
When combined with setting the `reactor.netty` log level to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`, it enables the logging of information, such as headers and bodies sent and received across the wire.
To enable wiretap, set `spring.cloud.gateway.httpserver.wiretap=true` or `spring.cloud.gateway.httpclient.wiretap=true` for the `HttpServer` and `HttpClient`, respectively.
