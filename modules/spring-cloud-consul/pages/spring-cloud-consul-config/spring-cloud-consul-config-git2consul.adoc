=== git2consul with Config
git2consul is a Consul community project that loads files from a git repository to individual keys into Consul. By default the names of the keys are names of the files. YAML and Properties files are supported with file extensions of `.yml` and `.properties` respectively.  Set the `spring.cloud.consul.config.format` property to `FILES`. For example:

.bootstrap.yml
----
spring:
  cloud:
    consul:
      config:
        format: FILES
----

Given the following keys in `/config`, the `development` profile and an application name of `foo`:

----
.gitignore
application.yml
bar.properties
foo-development.properties
foo-production.yml
foo.properties
master.ref
----

the following property sources would be created:

----
config/foo-development.properties
config/foo.properties
config/application.yml
----

The value of each key needs to be a properly formatted YAML or Properties file.
