=== Authenticating with the Eureka Server

HTTP basic authentication is automatically added to your eureka client if one of the `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone` URLs has credentials embedded in it (curl style, as follows: `https://user:password@localhost:8761/eureka`).
For more complex needs, you can create a `@Bean` of type `DiscoveryClientOptionalArgs` and inject `ClientFilter` instances into it, all of which is applied to the calls from the client to the server.

NOTE: Because of a limitation in Eureka, it is not possible to support per-server basic auth credentials, so only the first set that are found is used.
