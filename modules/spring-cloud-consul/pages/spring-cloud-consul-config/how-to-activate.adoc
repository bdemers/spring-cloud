=== How to activate

To get started with Consul Configuration use the starter with group `org.springframework.cloud` and artifact id `spring-cloud-starter-consul-config`. See the https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/[Spring Cloud Project page] for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.

This will enable auto-configuration that will setup Spring Cloud Consul Config.
