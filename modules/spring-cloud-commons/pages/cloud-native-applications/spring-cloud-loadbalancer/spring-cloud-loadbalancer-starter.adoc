=== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer Starter

We also provide a starter that allows you to easily add Spring Cloud LoadBalancer in a Spring Boot app.
In order to use it, just add `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer` to your Spring Cloud dependencies in your build file.

NOTE: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer starter includes
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html[Spring Boot Caching]
and https://github.com/stoyanr[Evictor].

WARNING: If you have both Ribbon and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer int the classpath, in order to maintain backward compatibility, Ribbon-based implementations will be used by default.
In order to switch to using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer under the hood, make sure you set the property `spring.cloud.loadbalancer.ribbon.enabled` to `false`.
