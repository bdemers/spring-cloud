=== Example: How to Use Ribbon Without Eureka

Eureka is a convenient way to abstract the discovery of remote servers so that you do not have to hard code their URLs in clients.
However, if you prefer not to use Eureka, Ribbon and Feign also work.
Suppose you have declared a `@RibbonClient` for "stores", and Eureka is not in use (and not even on the classpath).
The Ribbon client defaults to a configured server list.
You can supply the configuration as follows:

.application.yml
----
stores:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: example.com,google.com
----
