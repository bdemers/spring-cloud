=== The `PrefixPath` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `PrefixPath` `GatewayFilter` factory takes a single `prefix` parameter.
The following example configures a `PrefixPath` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: prefixpath_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - PrefixPath=/mypath
----
====

This will prefix `/mypath` to the path of all matching requests.
So a request to `/hello` would be sent to `/mypath/hello`.
