=== Retrieving Information about a Particular Route

To retrieve information about a single route, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/gateway/routes/{id}` (for example, `/actuator/gateway/routes/first_route`).
The resulting response is similar to the following:

====
----
{
  "id": "first_route",
  "predicates": [{
    "name": "Path",
    "args": {"_genkey_0":"/first"}
  }],
  "filters": [],
  "uri": "https://www.uri-destination.org",
  "order": 0
}]
----
====

The following table describes the structure of the response:

[cols="3,2,4"]
|===
| Path | Type | Description

|`id`
| String
| The route ID.

|`predicates`
| Array
| The collection of route predicates. Each item defines the name and the arguments of a given predicate.

|`filters`
| Array
| The collection of filters applied to the route.

|`uri`
| String
| The destination URI of the route.

|`order`
| Number
| The route order.
