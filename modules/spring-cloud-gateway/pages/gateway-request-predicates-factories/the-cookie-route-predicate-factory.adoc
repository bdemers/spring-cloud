=== The Cookie Route Predicate Factory

The cookie route predicate factory takes two parameters, the cookie name and a regular expression.
This predicate matches cookies that have the given name and whose values match the regular expression.
The following example configures a cookie route predicate factory:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: cookie_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Cookie=chocolate, ch.p
----
====

This route matches requests that have a cookie named `chocolate` whose value matches the `ch.p` regular expression.
