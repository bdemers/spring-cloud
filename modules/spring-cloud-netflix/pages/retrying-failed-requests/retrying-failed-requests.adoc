== Retrying Failed Requests

Spring Cloud Netflix offers a variety of ways to make HTTP requests.
You can use a load balanced `RestTemplate`, Ribbon, or Feign.
No matter how you choose to create your HTTP requests, there is always a chance that a request may fail.
When a request fails, you may want to have the request be retried automatically.
To do so when using Sping Cloud Netflix, you need to include https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] on your application's classpath.
When Spring Retry is present, load-balanced `RestTemplates`, Feign, and Zuul automatically retry any failed requests (assuming your configuration allows doing so).
