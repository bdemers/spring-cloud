=== Changing the Location of Bootstrap Properties

You can specify the `bootstrap.yml` (or `.properties`) location by setting `spring.cloud.bootstrap.name` (default: `bootstrap`) or `spring.cloud.bootstrap.location` (default: empty) -- for example, in system properties.
Those properties behave like the `spring.config.*` variants with the same name.
In fact, they are used to set up the bootstrap `ApplicationContext` by setting those properties in its `Environment`.
If there is an active profile (from `spring.profiles.active` or through the `Environment` API in the context you are building), properties in that profile get loaded as well, the same as in a regular Spring Boot app -- for example, from `bootstrap-development.properties` for a `development` profile.
