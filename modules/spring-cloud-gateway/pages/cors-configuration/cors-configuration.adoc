== CORS Configuration

You can configure the gateway to control CORS behavior. The "`global`" CORS configuration is a map of URL patterns to https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsConfiguration.html[Spring Framework `CorsConfiguration`].
The following example configures CORS:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      globalcors:
        corsConfigurations:
          '[/**]':
            allowedOrigins: "https://docs.spring.io"
            allowedMethods:
            - GET
----
====

In the preceding example, CORS requests are allowed from requests that originate from `docs.spring.io` for all GET requested paths.

To provide the same CORS configuration to requests that are not handled by some gateway route predicate, set the `spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors.add-to-simple-url-handler-mapping` property  to `true`.
This is useful when you try to support CORS preflight requests and your route predicate does not evalute to `true` because the HTTP method is `options`.
