=== Marking An Exchange As Routed

After the gateway has routed a `ServerWebExchange`, it marks that exchange as "`routed`" by adding `gatewayAlreadyRouted`
to the exchange attributes. Once a request has been marked as routed, other routing filters will not route the request again,
essentially skipping the filter. There are convenience methods that you can use to mark an exchange as routed
or check if an exchange has already been routed.

* `ServerWebExchangeUtils.isAlreadyRouted` takes a `ServerWebExchange` object and checks if it has been "`routed`".
* `ServerWebExchangeUtils.setAlreadyRouted` takes a `ServerWebExchange` object and marks it as "`routed`".
