=== Plain Embedded Zuul

If you use `@EnableZuulServer` (instead of `@EnableZuulProxy`), you can also run a Zuul server without proxying or selectively switch on parts of the proxying platform.
Any beans that you add to the application of type `ZuulFilter` are installed automatically (as they are with `@EnableZuulProxy`) but without any of the proxy filters being added automatically.

In that case, the routes into the Zuul server are still specified by configuring "zuul.routes.{asterisk}", but there is no service discovery and no proxying. Consequently, the "serviceId" and "url" settings are ignored.
The following example maps all paths in "/api/{all}" to the Zuul filter chain:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
 zuul:
  routes:
    api: /api/**
----
