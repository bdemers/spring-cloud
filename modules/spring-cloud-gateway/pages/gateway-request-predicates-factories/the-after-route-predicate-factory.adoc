=== The After Route Predicate Factory

The after route predicate factory takes one parameter, a datetime.
This predicate matches requests that happen after the specified datetime.
The following example configures an after route predicate:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: after_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - After=2017-01-20T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver]
----
====

This route matches any request made after Jan 20, 2017 17:42 Mountain Time (Denver).
