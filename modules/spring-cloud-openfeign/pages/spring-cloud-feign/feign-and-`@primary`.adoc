=== Feign and `@Primary`

When using Feign with Hystrix fallbacks, there are multiple beans in the `ApplicationContext` of the same type. This will cause `@Autowired` to not work because there isn't exactly one bean, or one marked as primary. To work around this, Spring Cloud Netflix marks all Feign instances as `@Primary`, so Spring Framework will know which bean to inject. In some cases, this may not be desirable. To turn off this behavior set the `primary` attribute of `@FeignClient` to false.
