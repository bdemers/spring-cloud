=== Combined Global Filter and `GatewayFilter` Ordering

When a request matches a route, the filtering web handler adds all instances of `GlobalFilter` and all route-specific instances of `GatewayFilter` to a filter chain.
This combined filter chain is sorted by the `org.springframework.core.Ordered` interface, which you can set by implementing the `getOrder()` method.

As Spring Cloud Gateway distinguishes between "`pre`" and "`post`" phases for filter logic execution (see xref:gateway-how-it-works:gateway-how-it-works.adoc#gateway-how-it-works[How it Works]), the filter with the highest precedence is the first in the "`pre`"-phase and the last in the "`post`"-phase.

The following listing configures a filter chain:

.ExampleConfiguration.java
====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public GlobalFilter customFilter() {
    return new CustomGlobalFilter();
}

public class CustomGlobalFilter implements GlobalFilter, Ordered {

    @Override
    public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {
        log.info("custom global filter");
        return chain.filter(exchange);
    }

    @Override
    public int getOrder() {
        return -1;
    }
}
