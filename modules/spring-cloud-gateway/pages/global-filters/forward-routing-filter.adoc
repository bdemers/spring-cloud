=== Forward Routing Filter

The `ForwardRoutingFilter` looks for a URI in the exchange attribute `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR`.
If the URL has a `forward` scheme (such as `forward:///localendpoint`), it uses the Spring `DispatcherHandler` to handle the request.
The path part of the request URL is overridden with the path in the forward URL.
The unmodified original URL is appended to the list in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_ORIGINAL_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` attribute.
