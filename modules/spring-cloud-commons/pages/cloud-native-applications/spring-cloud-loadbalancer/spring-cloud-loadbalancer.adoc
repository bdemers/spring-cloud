== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

Spring Cloud provides its own client-side load-balancer abstraction and implementation. For the load-balancing
mechanism, `ReactiveLoadBalancer` interface has been added and a Round-Robin-based implementation
has been provided for it. In order to get instances to select from reactive `ServiceInstanceListSupplier`
is used. Currently we support a service-discovery-based implementation of `ServiceInstanceListSupplier`
that retrieves available instances from Service Discovery using a xref:spring-cloud-commons:-common-abstractions:discovery-client.adoc#discovery-client[Discovery Client] available in the classpath.
