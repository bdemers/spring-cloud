=== The Header Route Predicate Factory

The header route predicate factory takes two parameters, the header name and a regular expression.
This predicate matches with a header that has the given name whose value matches the regular expression.
The following example configures a header route predicate:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: header_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Header=X-Request-Id, \d+
----
====

This route matches if the request has a header named `X-Request-Id` whose value matches the `\d+` regular expression (that is, it has a value of one or more digits).
