=== Activating

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-config` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Config.

CAUTION: When working with version 3.4 of Zookeeper you need to change
the way you include the dependency as described xref:spring-cloud-zookeeper-install:spring-cloud-zookeeper-install.adoc#spring-cloud-zookeeper-install[here].
