== Actuator API

The `/gateway` actuator endpoint lets you monitor and interact with a Spring Cloud Gateway application.
To be remotely accessible, the endpoint has to be https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-endpoints-enabling-endpoints[enabled] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints[exposed over HTTP or JMX] in the application properties.
The following listing shows how to do so:
