=== The RemoteAddr Route Predicate Factory

The RemoteAddr route predicate factory takes a list (min size 1) of CIDR-notation (IPv4 or IPv6) strings, such as `192.168.0.1/16` (where `192.168.0.1` is an IP address and `16` is a subnet mask).
The following example configures a RemoteAddr route predicate:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: remoteaddr_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - RemoteAddr=192.168.1.1/24
----
====

This route matches if the remote address of the request was, for example, `192.168.1.10`.
