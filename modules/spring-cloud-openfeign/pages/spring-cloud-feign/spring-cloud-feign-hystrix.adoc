=== Feign Hystrix Support

If Hystrix is on the classpath and `feign.hystrix.enabled=true`, Feign will wrap all methods with a circuit breaker. Returning a `com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand` is also available. This lets you use reactive patterns (with a call to `.toObservable()` or `.observe()` or asynchronous use (with a call to `.queue()`).

To disable Hystrix support on a per-client basis create a vanilla `Feign.Builder` with the "prototype" scope, e.g.:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class FooConfiguration {
    	@Bean
	@Scope("prototype")
	public Feign.Builder feignBuilder() {
		return Feign.builder();
	}
}
----

WARNING:  Prior to the Spring Cloud Dalston release, if Hystrix was on the classpath Feign would have wrapped
all methods in a circuit breaker by default.  This default behavior was changed in Spring Cloud Dalston in
favor for an opt-in approach.
