=== Zuul Timeouts

If you want to configure the socket timeouts and read timeouts for requests proxied through Zuul, you have two options, based on your configuration:

* If Zuul uses service discovery, you need to configure these timeouts with the
`ribbon.ReadTimeout` and `ribbon.SocketTimeout` Ribbon properties.

If you have configured Zuul routes by specifying URLs, you need to use
`zuul.host.connect-timeout-millis` and `zuul.host.socket-timeout-millis`.
