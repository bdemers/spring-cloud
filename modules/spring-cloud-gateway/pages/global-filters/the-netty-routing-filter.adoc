=== The Netty Routing Filter

The Netty routing filter runs if the URL located in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` exchange attribute has a `http` or `https` scheme.
It uses the Netty `HttpClient` to make the downstream proxy request.
The response is put in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.CLIENT_RESPONSE_ATTR` exchange attribute for use in a later filter.
(There is also an experimental `WebClientHttpRoutingFilter` that performs the same function but does not require Netty.)
