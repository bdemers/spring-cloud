=== Rewriting the `Location` header

If Zuul is fronting a web application, you may need to re-write the `Location` header when the web application redirects through a HTTP status code of `3XX`.
Otherwise, the browser redirects to the web application's URL instead of the Zuul URL.
You can configure a `LocationRewriteFilter` Zuul filter to re-write the `Location` header to the Zuul's URL.
It also adds back the stripped global and route-specific prefixes.
The following example adds a filter by using a Spring Configuration file:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.zuul.filters.post.LocationRewriteFilter;
...

@Configuration
@EnableZuulProxy
public class ZuulConfig {
    @Bean
    public LocationRewriteFilter locationRewriteFilter() {
        return new LocationRewriteFilter();
    }
}
----

CAUTION: Use this filter carefully. The filter acts on the `Location` header of ALL `3XX` response codes, which may not be appropriate in all scenarios, such as when redirecting the user to an external URL.
