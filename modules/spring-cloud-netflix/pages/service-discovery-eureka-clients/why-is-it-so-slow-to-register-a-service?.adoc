=== Why Is It so Slow to Register a Service?

Being an instance also involves a periodic heartbeat to the registry
(through the client's `serviceUrl`) with a default duration of 30 seconds.
A service is not available for discovery by clients until the instance, the server, and the client all have the same metadata in their local
cache (so it could take 3 heartbeats).
You can change the period by setting `eureka.instance.leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds`.
Setting it to a value of less than 30 speeds up the process of getting clients connected to other services.
In production, it is probably better to stick with the default, because of internal computations in the server that make assumptions about the lease renewal period.
