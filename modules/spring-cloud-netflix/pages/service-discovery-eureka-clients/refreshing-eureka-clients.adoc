=== Refreshing Eureka Clients

By default, the `EurekaClient` bean is refreshable, meaning the Eureka client properties can be changed and refreshed.
When a refresh occurs clients will be unregistered from the Eureka server and there might be a brief moment of time
where all instance of a given service are not available. One way to eliminate this from happening is to disable
the ability to refresh Eureka clients.  To do this set `eureka.client.refresh.enable=false`.
