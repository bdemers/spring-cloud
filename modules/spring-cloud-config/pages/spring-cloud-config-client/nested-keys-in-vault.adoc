=== Nested Keys In Vault

Vault supports the ability to nest keys in a value stored in Vault, as shown in the following example:

`echo -n '{"appA": {"secret": "appAsecret"}, "bar": "baz"}' | vault write secret/myapp -`

This command writes a JSON object to your Vault.
To access these values in Spring, you would use the traditional dot(`.`) annotation, as shown in the following example

[source,java]
----
@Value("${appA.secret}")
String name = "World";
----

The preceding code would sets the value of the `name` variable to `appAsecret`.
