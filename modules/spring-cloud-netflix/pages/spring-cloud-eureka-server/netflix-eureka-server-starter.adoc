=== How to Include Eureka Server

To include Eureka Server in your project, use the starter with a group ID of `org.springframework.cloud` and an artifact ID of `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server`.
See the https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/[Spring Cloud Project page] for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.

NOTE: If your project already uses Thymeleaf as its template engine, the Freemarker templates of the Eureka server may not be loaded correctly. In this case it is necessary to configure the template loader manually:

.application.yml
----
spring:
  freemarker:
    template-loader-path: classpath:/templates/
    prefer-file-system-access: false
----
