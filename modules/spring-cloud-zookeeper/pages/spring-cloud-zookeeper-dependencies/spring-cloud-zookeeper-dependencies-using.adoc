=== Using the Zookeeper Dependencies

Spring Cloud Zookeeper gives you a possibility to provide dependencies of your application
as properties. As dependencies, you can understand other applications that are registered
in Zookeeper and which you would like to call through
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#spring-cloud-feign[Feign]
(a REST client builder),
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/ascii[Spring
`RestTemplate`] and
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/html/#loadbalanced-webclient[Spring WebFlux].

You can also use the Zookeeper Dependency Watchers functionality to control and monitor
the state of your dependencies.
