=== Verbose Actuator Format

A new, more verbose format has been added to Spring Cloud Gateway.
It adds more detail to each route, letting you view the predicates and filters associated with each route along with any configuration that is available.
The following example configures `/actuator/gateway/routes`:

====
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "predicate": "(Hosts: [**.addrequestheader.org] && Paths: [/headers], match trailing slash: true)",
    "route_id": "add_request_header_test",
    "filters": [
      "[[AddResponseHeader X-Response-Default-Foo = 'Default-Bar'], order = 1]",
      "[[AddRequestHeader X-Request-Foo = 'Bar'], order = 1]",
      "[[PrefixPath prefix = '/httpbin'], order = 2]"
    ],
    "uri": "lb://testservice",
    "order": 0
  }
]
----
====

This feature is enabled by default. To disable it, set the following property:

.application.properties
====
[source,properties]
----
spring.cloud.gateway.actuator.verbose.enabled=false
----
====

This will default to `true` in a future release.
