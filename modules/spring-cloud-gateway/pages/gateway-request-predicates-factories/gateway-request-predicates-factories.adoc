== Route Predicate Factories

Spring Cloud Gateway matches routes as part of the Spring WebFlux `HandlerMapping` infrastructure.
Spring Cloud Gateway includes many built-in route predicate factories.
All of these predicates match on different attributes of the HTTP request.
You can combine multiple route predicate factories with logical `and` statements.
