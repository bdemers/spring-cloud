=== Activating Zookeeper Dependencies

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Dependencies. Even if you provide
the dependencies in your properties, you can turn off the dependencies. To do so, set the
`spring.cloud.zookeeper.dependency.enabled` property to false (it defaults to `true`).
