=== Ignored Headers

In addition to the route-sensitive headers, you can set a global value called `zuul.ignoredHeaders` for values (both request and response) that should be discarded during interactions with downstream services.
By default, if Spring Security is not on the classpath, these are empty.
Otherwise, they are initialized to a set of well known "`security`" headers (for example, involving caching) as specified by Spring Security.
The assumption in this case is that the downstream services might add these headers, too, but we want the values from the proxy.
To not discard these well known security headers when Spring Security is on the classpath, you can set `zuul.ignoreSecurityHeaders` to `false`.
Doing so can be useful if you disabled the HTTP Security response headers in Spring Security and want the values provided by downstream services.
