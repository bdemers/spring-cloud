== Service Discovery with Zookeeper

Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture. Trying to
hand-configure each client or some form of convention can be difficult to do and can be
brittle. https://curator.apache.org[Curator](A Java library for Zookeeper) provides Service
Discovery through a https://curator.apache.org/curator-x-discovery/[Service Discovery
Extension]. Spring Cloud Zookeeper uses this extension for service registration and
discovery.
