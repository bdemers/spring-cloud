=== Feign request/response compression

You may consider enabling the request or response GZIP compression for your
Feign requests. You can do this by enabling one of the properties:

[source,java]
----
feign.compression.request.enabled=true
feign.compression.response.enabled=true
----

Feign request compression gives you settings similar to what you may set for your web server:

[source,java]
----
feign.compression.request.enabled=true
feign.compression.request.mime-types=text/xml,application/xml,application/json
feign.compression.request.min-request-size=2048
----

These properties allow you to be selective about the compressed media types and minimum request threshold length.

For http clients except OkHttpClient, default gzip decoder can be enabled to decode gzip response in UTF-8 encoding:

[source,java]
----
feign.compression.response.enabled=true
feign.compression.response.useGzipDecoder=true
----
