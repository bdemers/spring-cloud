== Hystrix Timeouts And Ribbon Clients

When using Hystrix commands that wrap Ribbon clients you want to make sure your Hystrix timeout
is configured to be longer than the configured Ribbon timeout, including any potential
retries that might be made.  For example, if your Ribbon connection timeout is one second and
the Ribbon client might retry the request three times, than your Hystrix timeout should
be slightly more than three seconds.
