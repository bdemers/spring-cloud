=== Config First Bootstrap

The default behavior for any application that has the Spring Cloud Config Client on the classpath is as follows:
When a config client starts, it binds to the Config Server (through the `spring.cloud.config.uri` bootstrap configuration property) and initializes Spring `Environment` with remote property sources.

The net result of this behavior is that all client applications that want to consume the Config Server need a `bootstrap.yml` (or an environment variable) with the server address set in `spring.cloud.config.uri` (it defaults to "http://localhost:8888").
