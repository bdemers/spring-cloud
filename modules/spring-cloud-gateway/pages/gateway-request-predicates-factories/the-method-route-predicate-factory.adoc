=== The Method Route Predicate Factory

The Method Route Predicate Factory takes one or more parameters: the HTTP methods to match.
The following example configures a method route predicate:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: method_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Method=GET,POST
----
====

This route matches if the request method was a `GET` or a `POST`.
