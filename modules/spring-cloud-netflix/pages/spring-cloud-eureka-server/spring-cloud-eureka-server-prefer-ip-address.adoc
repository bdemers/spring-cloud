=== When to Prefer IP Address

In some cases, it is preferable for Eureka to advertise the IP addresses of services rather than the hostname.
Set `eureka.instance.preferIpAddress` to `true` and, when the application registers with eureka, it uses its IP address rather than its hostname.

[TIP]
====
If the hostname cannot be determined by Java, then the IP address is sent to Eureka.
Only explict way of setting the hostname is by setting `eureka.instance.hostname` property.
You can set your hostname at the run-time by using an environment variable -- for example, `eureka.instance.hostname=${HOST_NAME}`.
