=== The Websocket Routing Filter

If the URL located in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` exchange attribute has a `ws` or `wss` scheme, the websocket routing rilter runs. It uses the Spring WebSocket infrastructure to forward the websocket request downstream.

You can load-balance websockets by prefixing the URI with `lb`, such as `lb:ws://serviceid`.

NOTE: If you use https://github.com/sockjs[SockJS] as a fallback over normal HTTP, you should configure a normal HTTP route as well as the websocket Route.

The following listing configures a websocket routing filter:

.application.yml

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # SockJS route
      - id: websocket_sockjs_route
        uri: http://localhost:3001
        predicates:
        - Path=/websocket/info/**
      # Normal Websocket route
      - id: websocket_route
        uri: ws://localhost:3001
        predicates:
        - Path=/websocket/**
