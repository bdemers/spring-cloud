=== The Between Route Predicate Factory

The between route predicate factory takes two parameters, `datetime1` and `datetime2`.
This predicate matches requests that happen after `datetime1` and before `datetime2`.
The `datetime2` parameter must be after `datetime1`.
The following example configures a between route predicate:

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: between_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Between=2017-01-20T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver], 2017-01-21T17:42:47.789-07:00[America/Denver]
----
====

This route matches any request made after Jan 20, 2017 17:42 Mountain Time (Denver) and before Jan 21, 2017 17:42 Mountain Time (Denver).
This could be useful for maintenance windows.
