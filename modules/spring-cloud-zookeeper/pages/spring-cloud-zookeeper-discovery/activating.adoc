=== Activating

Including a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zookeeper-discovery` enables
autoconfiguration that sets up Spring Cloud Zookeeper Discovery.

NOTE: For web functionality, you still need to include
`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web`.

CAUTION: When working with version 3.4 of Zookeeper you need to change
the way you include the dependency as described xref:spring-cloud-zookeeper-install:spring-cloud-zookeeper-install.adoc#spring-cloud-zookeeper-install[here].
