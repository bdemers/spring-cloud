=== Registering a Listener

To register a listener, you must implement an interface called
`org.springframework.cloud.zookeeper.discovery.watcher.DependencyWatcherListener` and
register it as a bean. The interface gives you one method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
void stateChanged(String dependencyName, DependencyState newState);
----

If you want to register a listener for a particular dependency, the `dependencyName` would
be the discriminator for your concrete implementation. `newState` provides you with
information about whether your dependency has changed to `CONNECTED` or `DISCONNECTED`.
